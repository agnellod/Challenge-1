# Challenge-1
## main changes
- In this application i re-wrote some of the exisiting html code to make it more accesible to anyone visiting the site.
- while doing so also maintaining the original look of the site given to us.
- I changed all of the div elements to more descriptive elements such as nav, header, footer, section, and aside.
- In doing so i had to rename some of the css style elements to match the html file.
- I also added a link and ID to one of the clickable links at the top of the page in order to bring you to that section of the webpage.
- I faced a few challenges in this task but with more practice with css and html design reworking code to make it more accesible should be easy.
